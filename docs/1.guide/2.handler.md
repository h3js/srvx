# Fetch handler

Request handler is defined via `fetch` key since it is similar to [fetch][fetch] API. The input is a [Request][Request] object and handler should return a [Response][Response] or a promise if the server handler is async.

**Example:**

```js
import { serve } from "srvx";

serve({
  xRemoteAddress: true,
  async fetch(request) {
    return new Response(
      `
        <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hello there</h1>
        <p>You are visiting ${request.url} from ${request.xRemoteAddress}</p>
      `,
      { headers: { "Content-Type": "text/html" } },
    );
  },
});
```

## Additional properties

> srvx **never** patches, overrides or extends globals such as [Request][Request] and [Response][Response]. Only few lazy getters prefixed with `x` will optionally be added to the `request` object instance to allow server adoption of [Request][Request].

> [!TIP]
> You can use `xRequest` type for TypeScript usage.

### `request.xRemoteAddress?`

For [Node.js][Node.js], ([Deno][Deno] and [Bun][Bun] only if [`xRemoteAddress`](/guide/options#xremoteaddress) server option is enabled), `request.xRemoteAddress` allows to access connected client's ipv4/ipv6 address or hostname.

```js
import { serve } from "srvx";

serve({
  xRemoteAddress: true,
  fetch: (request) =>
    new Response(`Your ip address is ${request.xRemoteAddress}`),
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> In order to to provide cross-runtime consistency, a small wrapper function will be enabled for Deno and Bun runtimes if `xRemoteAddress` option is set.

### `request.xNode?`

[Node.js][Node.js] is supported through a proxy that wraps [node:IncomingMessage][IncomingMessage] as [Request][Request] and converting final state of [node:ServerResponse][ServerResponse] to [Response][Response].

If access to the underlying [Node.js][Node.js] request and response objects is required (only in Node.js runtime), you can access them via `request.xNode?.req` ([node:IncomingMessage][IncomingMessage]) and `request.xNode?.res` ([node:ServerResponse][ServerResponse]).

```js
import { serve } from "srvx";

serve({
  fetch: (request) => {
    if (request.xNode) {
      console.log("Node.js req path:", request.xNode?.req.path);
      req.xNode.res.statusCode = 418; // I'm a teapot!
    }
    return new Response("ok");
  },
});
```

> [!TIP]
> srvx implementation of [Request][Request] proxy directly uses the underlying [node:IncomingMessage][IncomingMessage] as source of trust. Any changes to [Request][Request] will be reflected to the underlying [node:IncomingMessage][IncomingMessage] and vise-versa.
