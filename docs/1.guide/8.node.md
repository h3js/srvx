# Node.js Support

> Learn more about Node.js compatibility with srvx.

> [!NOTE]
> This is an advanced section, explaining internal mechanism of srvx for Node.js support.

When you want to create a HTTP server using [Node.js][Node.js], you have to use [node:http](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) builtin.

**Example:** Simple Node.js server.

```js
import { createServer } from "node:http";

createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end("Hello, Node.js!");
}).listen(3000);
```

Whenever a new request is received, the request event is called with two objects: a request `req` object ([node:IncomingMessage][IncomingMessage]) to access HTTP request details and a response `res` object ([node:ServerResponse][ServerResponse]) that can be used to prepare and send a HTTP response. Popular framework such as [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) are also based on Node.js server API.

Recent JavaScript server runtimes like [Deno][Deno] and [Bun][Bun] have a different way to define a server which is similar to web [fetch][fetch] API.

**Example:** [Deno][Deno] HTTP server ([learn more](https://docs.deno.com/api/deno/~/Deno.serve)):

```js
Deno.serve({ port: 3000 }, (_req, info) => new Response("Hello, Deno!"));
```

**Example:** [Bun][Bun] HTTP server ([learn more](https://bun.sh/docs/api/http)):

```js
Bun.serve({ port: 3000, fetch: (req) => new Response("Hello, Bun!") });
```

As you probably noticed, there is a difference between [Node.js][Node.js] and [Deno][Deno] and [Bun][Bun]. The incoming request is a web [Request][Request] object and server response is a web [Response][Response] object. Accessing headers, request path, and preparing response is completely different between [Node.js][Node.js] and other runtimes.

While [Deno][Deno] and [Bun][Bun] servers are both based on web standards, There are differences between them. The way to provide options, server lifecycle, access to request info such as client IP which is not part of [Request][Request] standard are some examples.

## How Node.js Compatibility Works

srvx internally uses a lightweight proxy system that wraps [node:IncomingMessage][IncomingMessage] as [Request][Request] and converts the final state of [node:ServerResponse][ServerResponse] to a [Response][Response] object.

For each incoming request, instead of _fully cloning_ [Node.js][Node.js] request object with into a new [Request][Request] instance, srvx creates a proxy that _translates_ all property access and method calls between two interfaces.

With this method, we add **minimum amount of overhead** and can **optimize** internal implementation to leverage most of the possibilities with [Node.js][Node.js] native primitives. This method also has the advantage that there is **only one source of trust** ([Node.js][Node.js] request instance) and any changes to each interface will reflect the other ([node:IncomingMessage][IncomingMessage] <> [Request][Request]), **maximizing compatibility**. srvx will **never patch of modify** the global [Request][Request] and [Response][Response] constructors, keeping runtime natives untouched.

Internally, the fetch wrapper looks like this:

```ts
function nodeHandler(nodeReq: IncomingMessage, nodeRes: ServerResponse) {
  const request = new NodeRequestProxy(nodeReq);
  const response = await server.fetch(request);
  await sendNodeResponse(nodeRes, response);
}
```

... `NodeRequestProxy`, wraps [node:IncomingMessage][IncomingMessage] as a standard [Request][Request] interface. <br>
... On first `request.body` access, it starts reading request body as a [ReadableStream][ReadableStream]. <br>
... `request.headers` is a proxy (`NodeReqHeadersProxy`) around `nodeReq.headers` providing a standard [Headers][Headers] interface. <br>
... When accessing `request.url` getter, it creates a full URL string (including protocol, hostname and path) from `nodeReq.url` and `nodeReq.headers` (host). <br>
... Other request APIs are also implemented similarly.

`sendNodeResponse`, handles the [Response][Response] object returned from server fetch method.

... `status`, `statusText`, and `headers` will be set. <br>
... `set-cookie` header will be properly split (with [cookie-es](https://cookie-es.unjs.io)). <br>
... If response has body, it will be streamed to node response. <br>
... The promise will be resolved after the response is sent and callback called by Node.js. <br>

## `FastResponse`

When initializing a new [Response][Response] in Node.js, a lot of extra internals have to be initialized including a [ReadableStream][ReadableStream] object for `response.body` and [Headers][Headers] for `response.headers` which adds significant overhead since Node.js response handling does not need them.

Until there will be native [Response][Response] handling support in Node.js http module, srvx provides a faster alternative `Response` class. You can use this instead to replace `Response` and improve performance.

```js
import { serve, FastResponse } from "srvx";

const server = serve({
  port: 3000,
  fetch() {
    return new FastResponse("Hello!");
  },
});

await server.ready();

console.log(`Server running at ${server.url}`);
```

You can locally run benchmarks by cloning [srvx repository](https://github.com/h3js/srvx) and running `npm run bench:node [--all]` script. Speedup in v22.8.0 was roughly **%94**!

## Reverse Compatibility

srvx converts a [fetch][fetch]-like [Request][Request] => [Response][Response] handler to [node:IncomingMessage][IncomingMessage] => [node:ServerResponse][ServerResponse] handler that is compatible **with** Node.js runtime.

If you want to instead convert a Node.js server handler (like [Express][Express]) with `(req, IncomingMessage, res: ServerResponse)` signature to [fetch][fetch]-like handler ([Request][Request] => [Response][Response]) that can work **without** Node.js runtime you can instead use [node-mock-http](https://github.com/unjs/node-mock-http) or [fetch-to-node](https://github.com/mhart/fetch-to-node) (more mature but currently requires some `node:` polyfills).

```js [node-mock-http.mjs]
import { fetchNodeRequestHandler } from "node-mock-http";

// Node.js compatible request handler
const nodeHandler = (req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "application/json" });
  res.end(
    JSON.stringify({
      data: "Hello World!",
    }),
  );
};

// Create a Response object
const webResponse = await fetchNodeRequestHandler(nodeHandler, webRequest);
```

```js [fetch-to-node.mjs]
import { toReqRes, toFetchResponse } from "fetch-to-node";

// Node.js compatible request handler
const nodeHandler = (req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "application/json" });
  res.end(
    JSON.stringify({
      data: "Hello World!",
    }),
  );
};

// Create Node.js-compatible req and res from request
const { req, res } = toReqRes(webRequest);

// Create a Response object based on res, and return it
const webResponse = await toFetchResponse(res);
```
