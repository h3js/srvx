# Getting Started

> Get to know srvx and familiarize yourself with basic usage.

Simply put, **srvx** is a compatibility layer for Node APIs. What this means is that it acts as a unified standard API to create HTTP servers based on the standard web platform primitives ([Fetch][Fetch], [Request][Request], and [Response][Response]) which integrates seamlessly with [Deno][Deno], [Bun][Bun], [Node.js][Node], and more.

For Deno and Bun (and [others](/guide/advanced/experimental)), **srvx** provides this unified interface at zero overhead by wrapping Node in as lithe an abstraction as possible.
This abstractive wrapper then consumes any [node:IncomingMessage][IncomingMessage] as a web standard [Request][Request] object and converts its final state of a [node:ServerResponse][ServerResponse] into the web standard [Response][Response] object.
This is the lightweight compatibility layer

## Quick Start

First, create an HTTP server using the `serve` function from the `srvx` package.

```js [server.mjs]
import { serve } from "srvx";

const server = serve({
  fetch(request) {
    return new Response("ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!");
  },
});
```

Then, install `srvx` as a dependency:

:pm-install{name="srvx"}

Finally, run the server using your favorite runtime:

::code-group

```bash [node]
node server.mjs
```

```bash [deno]
deno run --allow-env --allow-net server.mjs
```

```bash [bun]
bun run server.mjs
```
