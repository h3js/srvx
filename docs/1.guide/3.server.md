# Server Instance

> Control srvx server lifecycle.

When calling `serve` to start a server, a server instance will be immediately returned in order to control the server instance.

```js
import { serve } from "srvx";

const server = serve({
  fetch(request) {
    return new Response(`ðŸ”¥ Server is powered by ${server.runtime}.`);
  },
});

await server.ready();

console.log(`ðŸš€ Server is ready at ${server.url}`);

// When server is no longer needed
// await server.close(true /* closeActiveConnections */)
```

## Server Properties

### `server.options`

Access to the sever options set during initialization.

:read-more{to="/guide/options"}

### `server.url`

Get the computed server listening URL.

### `server.addr`

Listening address (hostname or ipv4/ipv6).

### `server.port`

Listening port number.

:read-more{to="/guide/options#port-required"}

## Server Methods

### `server.ready()`

Returns a promise that will be resolved when server is listening to the port and ready to accept connections.

**Example:**

```js
await server.ready();
```

### `server.close(closeActiveConnections?)`

Stop listening to prevent new connections from being accepted.

By default, calling `close` does not cancel in-flight requests or websockets. That means it may take some time before all network activity stops.

If `closeActiveConnections` is set to `true`, it will immediately terminate in-flight requests, websockets, and stop accepting new connections.

**Example:**

```js
// Stop accepting new requests
await server.close();

// Stop accepting new requests and cancel all current connections
await server.close(true);
```

## Access to the Underlying Server

> [!NOTE]
> srvx tries to translate most common options to op level properties. This is only for advanced usage.

### `server.bun.server`

Access to the underlying Bun server instance when running in Bun.

### `server.deno.server`

Access to the underlying Bun server instance when running in Deno.

:read-more{to="https://docs.deno.com/api/deno/~/Deno.HttpServer"}

### `server.node.server`
