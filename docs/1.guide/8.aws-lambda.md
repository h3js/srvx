# AWS Lambda

> AWS Lambda compatibility

srvx provides an AWS Lambda compatibility adapter that handles all the necessary transformations between AWS Lambda's event format and standard web Request/Response objects.

To use the AWS Lambda adapter, import the `toLambdaHandler` function from `"srvx/aws-lambda"`:

```ts
import { toLambdaHandler } from "srvx/aws-lambda";

export const handler = toLambdaHandler({
  fetch(req: Request) {
    return Response.json({ hello: "world!" });
  },
});
```

The `toLambdaHandler` function accepts a `ServerOptions` object as its parameter (see [Server Options](/guide/options) for details). However, since this is a serverless environment, options related to the server instance like `host` and `port` are not respected and will be ignored.

You can find a complete example of AWS Lambda in the [examples/aws-lambda](https://github.com/h3js/srvx/tree/main/examples/aws-lambda) directory, which includes configuration for the Serverless Framework and demonstrates how to set up API Gateway endpoints.
